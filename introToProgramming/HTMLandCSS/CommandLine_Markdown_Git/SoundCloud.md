The new feature lets you see the top 50 songs across the service by week at any given time and breaks them down further into genres. You’ll see how many plays it’s gotten this week, as well as how many it’s received overall.

SoundCloud is a great place for finding new music from emerging artists, but its explore feature was seeing big competition from competitors like Spotify’s Discover Weekly, which delivers personalized playlists every week.
